Git Rebase

With git-rebase you can push local commits together into one commit (without force). With rebase, you can commit more often and then merge your commits together before pushing back to the shared repo. For simplicity, we are only going to talk about rebasing locally. This is a little more complicated to explain, so it is easier to just show a simple example.
